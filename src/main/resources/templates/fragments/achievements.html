                        Authored a research paper on developing an advanced ensemble machine learning model for liver cancer
                        prediction, integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide transparent, interpretable insights
                        for clinical decision-making. The study demonstrates how stacking ensemble models, combined with tools
                        like SHAP, can significantly improve predictive accuracy and help medical professionals
                        understand the key clinical factors influencing each prediction. This work contributes to the
                        growing field of AI-driven healthcare by bridging model performance with interpretability.
